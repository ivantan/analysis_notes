__Definition 1__   
A set $A \subseteq R$ is **bounded above** if there exists a number $b \in R$ such that for all $a \in A, a \le b$.  
This number $b$ is called an upper bound for $A$.  

1. one
2. two
3. three

__Definition 2__  
A real number $s$ is a **least upper bound** for a set $A \subseteq R$ if

1. $s$ is an upper bound of $A$ and also  
2. $s$ is less or equal to any upper bound of $A$.
